Website team tasks for Konstantin
- Sponsors output in footer (Do we need to only show certain speakers in footer or all (it could be lots)?)
- Sponsors page
- Drop down menus (On github there is an image for what this should look like)
- Remove background image on mobile sites and use the green background: #119966
- Come up with a sketch / mockup for the social media page. This will be a page to showcase facebook, twitter and buzz about WCEU. I'm leaving this design up to you. Either ping me or upload sketch here when want eyes on it.
- Come up with a sketch / mockup for the timetable for the event page. This should work on a mobile device well. Tables are fine and probably the most sensible method. Please use the branded colors of red/ green already on site. Don't add new fonts either. Either ping me or upload sketch here when want eyes on it.
- Come up with a sketch / mockup for the location page. http://2014.europe.wordcamp.org/location/ We should have all places including after party there. Also add in maps.
